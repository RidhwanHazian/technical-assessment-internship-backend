# Technical Assessment â€“ Backend Developer

This repository contains the completed solution for a .NET console application used in a technical assessment for a backend developer internship.

## Description

The program is a simple console-based "Item Manager" that allows users to add, remove, and display a list of items. The assessment focuses on debugging, working with generics, interfaces, and improving code structure.

## Completed Tasks

1. **Part One:** Fixed build and runtime errors caused by uninitialized variables and incorrect method calls.
2. **Part Two:** Implemented the missing `RemoveItem` method with proper validation.
3. **Part Three:** Introduced a `Fruit` class and used the generic `ItemManager<Fruit>` to add and print fruit objects.
4. **Part Four:** Created and implemented an interface `IItemManager` for better code structure and extensibility.
5. **Part Five:** Refactored `BadProgram.cs` for cleaner, more maintainable code. This included applying async/await for non-blocking operations and improving property handling and method structure.

## Git Commit Instructions

The work has been committed in separate stages to reflect the progress for each task. Each part of the assessment is included in its own commit for clarity and traceability. Additional commits were made to refine and test the implementation.
